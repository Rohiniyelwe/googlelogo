  At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which 
  can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a
  document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a
  table?),  structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a
  header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content 
  such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first 
  two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
